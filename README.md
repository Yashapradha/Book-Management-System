# Book-Management-System

Book management interface: The code sets up a simple web interface for managing books. It includes input fields for book name, author name, book description, and the number of pages. Users can add books using the "Add Book" button.

Dynamic display of books: Upon adding books, the showbooks() function dynamically generates HTML content to display the list of added books. It formats and structures the book details using JavaScript's map() function to create HTML elements for each book, including buttons for editing and deleting individual book entries.
